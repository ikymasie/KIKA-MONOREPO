To ensure a SACCOS is "bank-ready" and compliant with the **Co-operative Societies Act**, its Bye-Laws must serve as a legal manual for financial discipline. Banks will scrutinize these specifically to ensure the society has the legal authority to borrow and a structured way to repay.

Here are the specific **Bye-Law Requirements** and the corresponding system configurations needed to support them:

---

## 1. Objects and Powers to Borrow

The Bye-Laws must explicitly state that the SACCOS has the power to borrow money from financial institutions.

* **Bye-Law Provision:** A clause defining the "Maximum Liability" the society can incur. This is usually set at an Annual General Meeting (AGM) and must be approved by the Director for Co-operative Development.
* **System Integration:** The **Accounting Module** should have a "Debt Ceiling" monitor that alerts the board when total external loans approach the AGM-approved limit.

## 2. Capital Structure & Common Good Fund

Banks look for "skin in the game." Your Bye-Laws must define how much capital is permanently held by the society.

* **Share Capital:** Unlike savings, share capital is usually non-withdrawable but transferable. This acts as the society's equity.
* **Statutory Reserve Fund:** In Botswana, a percentage of the annual net surplus (often 25%) must be transferred to a Reserve Fund.
* **System Integration:** The **Accounting Module** must automate these transfers during the "End of Year" closing process to ensure the Balance Sheet always reflects legal compliance.

## 3. Credit Committee & Loan Policy

A bank will only lend to a SACCOS if they trust the SACCOS's own lending internal controls.

* **Committee Mandate:** The Bye-Laws must establish a Credit Committee responsible for approving member loans.
* **Security for Loans:** Rules on "Co-guarantorship" (members guaranteeing each other) or physical collateral must be defined.
* 
**System Integration:** The **Claims & Finance Module** should require "Dual Authorization"—where a loan cannot be disbursed until a Credit Committee member and a Treasurer both digitally sign off in the system.



## 4. Liquidity and Investment Rules

To protect the bank's interest, the SACCOS must prove it doesn't "lend out every cent" it has.

* **Liquidity Ratio:** A requirement to keep a certain percentage (e.g., 10%) of member savings in liquid form (cash or near-cash).
* **System Integration:** A **Liquidity Dashboard** for the Regulator and Board that shows real-time cash-to-savings ratios.
