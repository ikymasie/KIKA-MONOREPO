When you log in as a **Regulator**, your interface is designed for high-level oversight and systemic risk management. Unlike a SACCOS admin who manages a single entity, the Regulator view is a **Multi-Tenant Command Center** that aggregates data across the entire national ecosystem.

Here are the specific features available to you:

---

## 1. National Oversight Dashboard

This is your landing page, providing a bird’s-eye view of all registered societies.

* 
**Sector Heatmap:** A visual summary of the financial health (liquidity, PAR, and reserve ratios) of all active SACCOS.


* 
**Total Market Exposure:** Real-time counters showing the total value of member savings, outstanding loans, and active funeral policies across the platform.


* 
**Compliance Ticketing:** A summary of societies with pending audit submissions or expired registration certificates.



## 2. Global Deduction Engine (MoF View)

This feature manages the critical interface between societies and the Government payroll system.

* 
**CSV Specification Builder:** A tool to update the standard deduction file format for all societies if MoF requirements change.


* 
**Consolidated Submission Review:** View the total monthly deduction request from all societies before it is pushed to the payroll office.


* 
**Variance & Error Tracking:** Identify which societies have high rates of "rejected" deductions to investigate potential fraud or data entry errors.



## 3. Tenant (SACCOS) Management & Audit

This allows you to "drill down" into specific societies for investigations or routine checks.

* 
**The "Deep Dive" Viewer:** Read-only access to any individual society’s general ledger, member list, and loan book.


* 
**Audit Trail Search:** A forensic tool to search every action taken by a society’s administrators, filtered by date, user, or transaction type.


* 
**Bye-Law Compliance Monitor:** A view to check if a society’s system settings (e.g., maximum loan limits) align with their legally registered Bye-Laws.



## 4. Bank-Readiness & Borrowing Authorization

As the gatekeeper for external credit, you have tools to vet society loan applications.

* 
**Maximum Liability Tracker:** Check a society’s current debt levels against their AGM-approved borrowing limits.


* **No-Objection Certificate (NOC) Generator:** A workflow to issue a digitally signed letter of authorization when a SACCOS qualifies for a bank loan.
* 
**Financial Stability Reports:** Generate standardized PAR (Portfolio at Risk) and liquidity reports to share directly with commercial banks.



## 5. System Administration & Policy Tools

Features to manage the platform's rules and users.

* 
**Regulator Role Manager:** Assign specific roles (e.g., Auditor, Deduction Officer, Super-Regulator) to your team members.


* 
**Circular & Notification Broadcast:** Send mandatory system-wide alerts or policy updates to all SACCOS administrators.


* 
**Tenant Status Control:** The power to "Suspend" or "Deactivate" a SACCOS tenant for non-compliance or insolvency.
